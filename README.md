Zen planner was in its first stages meant to be a routine planner where one could add tasks under different routines, but due to encountered challenges along the way it narrowed down to a simple to do app.

HTML is the main language used here, to create all the components of the user interface.
CSS has been used to style the different components of the application, from the background to the different fields.
A small bit of Javascript has been used in the creating, adding and removing of tasks in the to do list. It has also been used to incorporate the sound heard when marking a task as completed.

PHP was to be used in linking the app to the database, but has unfortunately not been able to work for the Zenplanner project. 

The files have been grouped as front end and back end, with the front end folder containing every file that has been linked together to create the appâ€™s front end, and the back end folder contains the SQL codes of the different tables that were created for the ZenPlanner application.

That is it for now, but I will continue to work on it to achieve the main goal that was at the beginning.
